# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Program Projects

**DESCRIPTION:**

Welcome to my repository for the **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program**! This program provided a comprehensive introduction to data analysis using Python, focusing on essential libraries such as **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**. Throughout the course, I completed three main projects, each designed to enhance my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and analysis.

## Projects:

1. **Investigate a Dataset: No Show Appointments**  
   Applied the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data using Python libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

2. **Real World Data Wrangling with Python: Movies**  
   Learned advanced data wrangling techniques, including gathering, assessing, and cleaning data to transform raw and messy data into a clean format for analysis.

3. **Communicate Data Findings: Ford GoBike System Data**  
   Applied data visualization principles using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to tell compelling stories with data through analysis and visualizations.
